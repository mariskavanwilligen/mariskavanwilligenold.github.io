## Introduction of Time Series forecasting

## Components of Time Series
Time series analysis provides a body of techniques to better understand a dataset.
Perhaps the most useful of these is the decomposition of a time series into 4 constituent parts:

- **Level**:  The baseline value for the series if it were a straight line.
- **Trend**: The optional and often linear increasing or decreasing behavior of the series over time.
- **Seasonality**: The optional repeating patterns or cycles of behavior over time.
- **Noise**: The optional variability in the observations that cannot be explained by the model.

```js
y = level + trend + seasonality + noise
```
