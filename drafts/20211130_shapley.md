Summary: Short introduction about Shapley value and how they can be used to explain machine learning models

## Introduction
This will be about the Shapley value

How do we get from the base rate to the prediction made?

> Let's have a look!

## Data Set Information:

The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult: [Web Link] or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.


Attribute Information:

For more information, read [Cortez et al., 2009].
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol
Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)



``` js
# Some code example
import pyspark
from pyspark.context import SparkContext
from pyspark.sql.session import SparkSession
sc = SparkContext('local')
spark = SparkSession(sc)

wine_data = spark.read.csv('data/winequality-red.csv', header=True, inferSchema=True)

wine_data.limit(5).toPandas()
```

``` js
wine_data = wine_data.toPandas()
y = wine_data['quality']
X = wine_data[['fixed acidity', 'volatile acidity', 'citric acid', 'residual sugar',
       'chlorides', 'free sulfur dioxide', 'total sulfur dioxide', 'density',
       'pH', 'sulphates', 'alcohol']]

# a simple linear model
model = sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)
```
![](/images/shapley/model_fit.png)

``` js
print("Model coefficients:\n")
for i in range(X.shape[1]):
    print(X.columns[i], "=", model.coef_[i].round(8))
```
