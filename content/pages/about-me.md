Title: About me
Slug: about-me

Hi, My name is Mariska van Willigen. 24 years old and I work as a data scientist for Albert Heijn.
In May 2021 I graduated and got my masters degree in Statistical Science for the Life and Behavioural sciences at Leiden Univerisity.

I want to challenge myself with this blog. Find some intresting topics to write about etc. It is all about the learning process and this blog can help me keep track on everything I will learn.
