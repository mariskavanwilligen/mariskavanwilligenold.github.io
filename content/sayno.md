**Often end up in uncomfortable and messy situations which could totally be avoided if you'd have said NO?**

Almost everyone has been saying 'No' to certain favour or a task isn't as easy as one might think.

If not said right, it can often ruin friendships, relationships and a lot more. But agreeing to do something, that doesn't seem right or is uncomfortable for you isn't also always the right way to go.

>>So, what should one do in these situations? How to say 'No' politely.

## Here are 7 ways for you to say 'NO' in a polite manner:
1. NO
2. I'm honoured but I can't
3. I wish there were two of me
4. Unfortunately, now is not a good time.
5. Sorry, I'm booked into something else right now
6. Damn, not able to fit this one in!
7. I have another commitment (can we teach men this sentence?)
