Summary: A short deepdive into Prophet & NeuralProphet with an example to predict sales

Prophet is a procedure released by Facebook for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. Prophet (2017) is the predecessor to NeuralProphet (2020) — the latter combines the Prophet model with deep learning.

# Prophet
According to Facebook, Prophet offers a straightforward way to create a ‘reasonable and accurate forecast’
The Prophet procedure is an additive regression model with four main components:
— a piecewise linear logistic growth curve trend
- a yearly seasonal component modelled using Fourier series
- a weekly seasonal component created using dummy variables
- a user-provided list of important holidays.

<!-- # Trend

# Seasonality -->

# Trend Changepoints
Changepoints are the points in time where the rate is changed. This can be due to a different marketing strategy or opening a new distribution centre for example. By default, Prophet specifies 25 potential changepoints which are uniformly placed in the first 80% of the time series.
The vertical lines are where the changepoints are defined:

Within that 80% 12 changepoints are uniformily selected:

- `n_changepoints` : You can specify how many changepoints you want to be selected, however you can better tune this with adding regularization.
- `changepoint_range`: This is to specify how big the range should be of with Prophet will place the n changepoints. Default is set to 0.80. Which means that the n changepoint will be placed in the first 80% of the time series. This 80% is chosen to avoid overfitting.
- `changepoint.prior.scale`: If the trend changes are being overfit (too much flexibility) or underfit (not enough flexibility), you can adjust the strength of the sparse prior. Default is set to 0.05, increasing will lead to more flexibility.


You are also able to specify changepoints yourself, for example if you know specific timestamps on which you expect a rate change or if Prophet missed a changepoint or overfits on the data. You can do this by giving Prophet a list of changepoint to the model:
```js
m = Prophet(changepoints=['2019-01-01', '2020-01-01', '2021-01-01'])
forecast = m.fit(df).predict(future)
fig = m.plot(forecast)
```

# Holidays
Below you can find an example to specify your holidays. Lower window ad upper window defines how much effect of this holiday you expect to last before and after the date of ds. 
```js
holidays = []
kerst = pd.DataFrame({
  'holiday': 'kerst',
  'ds': pd.to_datetime(['2017-12-25', '2018-12-25', '2019-12-25', 
                        '2020-12-25', '2021-12-25', '2022-12-25', 
                        '2023-12-25', '2024-12-25', '2025-12-25',
                       '2026-12-25', '2027-12-25', '2028-12-25']),
  'lower_window': -3,
  'upper_window': 1,
})
nye = pd.DataFrame({
  'holiday': 'nye',
  'ds': pd.to_datetime(['2017-12-31', '2018-12-31', '2019-12-31', 
                        '2020-12-31', '2021-12-31', '2022-12-31', 
                        '2023-12-31', '2024-12-31', '2025-12-31',
                       '2026-12-31', '2027-12-31', '2028-12-31']),
  'lower_window': -1,
  'upper_window': 1,
})
holidays = pd.concat((kerst, nye))
```
After the holidays are specified, you can give the holidays to your Prophet model as follows:
```js
m = Prophet(holidays=holidays)
forecast = m.fit(df).predict(future)
```

# How to use Prophet
Make sure in the preprocessing of youre data that the time column is defined as **ds** (for example date). And the dependent variable as **y**:
```js
regressors = [
  'LogTempAvg',
  'WeekDayNbr',
]

def prep_prophet_table(df):
  prophet_df = (
    df
    .withColumn('ds', F.col('Date'))
    .withColumn('y', F.log(F.col('Sales')))
    .withColumn('RunDate', F.lit(datetime.now().date())) # identify maximum training point based on current date
    .withColumn('TrainHistory', F.when(datediff(col('Date'), F.col('RunDate')) < -7, 1).otherwise(0)) # training indicator, one week before current day
    .withColumn('LogTempAvg', F.log(F.col('TempAvg')))
    .fillna(0, subset = [
                         'Sales',
                         'LogTempAvg'
                        ])
                        
    .select('RunDate',
            'ds',
            'Sales',
            'TrainHistory',
            'y',
            *regressors)
    .orderBy('ds')
  )
  
  return prophet_df
```


```js
def forecast_product(trans_prep, starttestdate: str, endtestdate: str):
  m_reg = Prophet(
    seasonality_prior_scale = 7, 
    changepoint_prior_scale = 0.02, 
    uncertainty_samples=0, 
    holidays = holidays)

  starttestdate = pd.to_datetime(starttestdate).date()
  endtestdate = pd.to_datetime(endtestdate).date()

  df_reg = (
    trans_prep.query('ds < @starttestdate')
  )
  for reg in regressors:
       m_reg.add_regressor(reg)

  m_reg.fit(df_reg)
  fc_df_reg = m_reg.predict(trans_prep.query('@starttestdate <= ds  & ds < @endtestdate'))

  for i in grab_cols: # rename columns for output name: _reg_ 
        fc_df_reg = fc_df_reg.rename(columns = {i: "_reg_"+i})

  for reg in grab_cols_reg:
    if not reg in fc_df_reg:
      fc_df_reg[reg] = 0.0

  storenbr = trans_prep['StoreNbr'].values[0]
  rundate = trans_prep['RunDate'].values[0]
  fc_df_reg['PredSales'] = np.exp(fc_df_reg['yhat'])
  out_df_reg = fc_df_reg[['ds','yhat','PredSales', *grab_cols_reg]].assign(RunDate = rundate).assign(StoreNbr = storenbr)
  return out_df_reg
```

How can you use this function:

```js
grab_cols = regressors + ['trend','yearly','weekly']
grab_cols_reg = ['_reg_' + reg for reg in grab_cols] 
regressor_schema = ','.join(['{} float'.format(x) for x in grab_cols_reg])
pandas_udf_schema = 'StoreNbr int, RunDate date, ds date, yhat float, PredSales float,' + regressor_schema 
```

- make partitioning and runs item forecasts, then apply prophet

```js
forecast_product_udf = pandas_udf(forecast_product, pandas_udf_schema, PandasUDFType.GROUPED_MAP)

prophet_fc_traintest = (
  prep_prophet_table(trans_pre)
  .groupby('StoreNbr')
  .apply(forecast_product_udf)
  .withColumn('Date',col('ds'))
)
```

# Disadvantage
The challenge with Facebook Prophet is that it does not look for casual relationships between the past and the future. It simply finds the best curve to fit the data using a linear logistic curve component for the external regressor. Another major criticism against Prophet is that its underlying assumptions are simplistic and weak. 

Prophet is hard to extend because Prophet is built upon Stan. It uses Stan for optimization and/or sampling in order to fit a non-linear additive model and generate uncertainty intervals. NeuralProphet is built upon PyTorch with the use of standard deep learning models and therefore easier to be extended.

# Neural Prophet
Prophet is a quite easy and understandable tool to predict time series. However, performance is not (yet) very good. Therefore NeuralProphet is introduced. A less explainable model, but with on average a higher performance. In short: NeuralProphet = Neural Networks + Prophet. The main goal is to gain efficiency while limiting the loss of interpretability. NeuralProphet uses auto-regression and covariate modules as neural networks.

The autoregressive (AR) process is probably the most used time series process to capture dependence over time among the random variables in a series.
By default, the neural network makes use of the simplest existing architecture: no intermediate layer, no activation function, only p inputs connected to h outputs


# Example Neural Prophet
```js
def forecast_n_product(trans_prep):
  m_reg = NeuralProphet()

  starttestdate = pd.to_datetime("2019-11-11").date()
  endtestdate = pd.to_datetime("2020-01-01").date()

  df_reg = (
    trans_prep.query('ds < @starttestdate')
  )
  m_reg.fit(df_reg[['ds', 'y']], freq = 'D', epochs=5000)

  fc_df_reg = m_reg.predict(trans_prep[['ds', 'y']].query('@starttestdate <= ds  & ds < @endtestdate'))

  storenbr = trans_prep['StoreNbr'].values[0]
  rundate = trans_prep['RunDate'].values[0]
  fc_df_reg['PredSales'] = np.exp(fc_df_reg['yhat1'])
  
  out_df_reg = fc_df_reg[['ds','yhat1','PredSales']].assign(RunDate = rundate).assign(StoreNbr = storenbr)

  return out_df_reg
```
