Summary: Basics of Object-oriented python programming: Inheritance explained

## Inheritance
Inheritance is a very important feature of object oriented programming (OOP). It refers to a class that uses almost all attributes and methods of another class. The new class is called the **child** or **subclass**. The already existing class is called the **parent** or **base class**. 
There are different options to modify or extend the inherinted class, such as overriding some attributes or overriding some methods.

## Overriding attributes
You can override an attribute of the parent class in the subclass:
``` js
class Product(object):
    product = "Coca Cola"

class NewProduct(Product):
    product = "Fanta"
```
Any instance of the new class will have the *Fanta* as product. Any instance of the parent/original class will have as product *Coca Cola*.

## Overriding methods
Same as with overriding methods:
``` js
class Product(object):
    def forecast_product(self, lift_factor=5)
        forecast = self.last_sales * factor
        return forecast

class NewProduct(Product):
    def forecast_product(self, lift_factor=5)
        forecast = self.last_sales * lift_factor * math.sqrt(2)
        return forecast

```
The subclass has a changed *forecast_product* function. Instances from the parent/original class will still have the old function *forecast_product* from the parent class.

However, if you override something in the subclass, be aware of the OOP principles. The subclass should always be substantially similar to its parents. *Liskov Substitution Principle* refers to the principle which says that objects of a parentclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.

## Extending methods
Sometimes you want to extend the *__intit__*. With the **super()** function you can call methods from the parentclass in your childclass. You can extend the functionallity of this inherited method. 

Example from *realpython.com*:
``` js
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width

    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * self.length + 2 * self.width

# Here we declare that the Square class inherits from the Rectangle class
class Square(Rectangle):
    def __init__(self, length):
        super().__init__(length, length
square = Square(4)
quare.area()        
``` 
Because the methods are so similar you can call superclass **__init__** function with **super()**. With a small extention that will set the length and width equal and you only need to give a signle length parameter to the square class.

## Check inheritances
With the functions **isinstance()** and **issubclass()** you can check the inheritance.

**isinstance(object, clasinfo)** checks whether a specific object is an instance of a class
**issubclass(class, classinfo)** checks whether one class is a subclass of another class

``` js
class X:
    pass
     
class Y(X):
    pass

x = X()
y = Y()  

isinstance(y, X)
# True
isinstance(x, Y)
# False

issubclass(Y, X)
# True
issubclass(X, Y)
# False
issubclass(X, X)
# True
```
