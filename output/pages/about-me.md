Title: About me
Slug: about-me

Hi, My name is Mariska van Willigen. 25 years old and I work as a Machine Learning Engineer for Albert Heijn.
In May 2021 I graduated and got my master's degree in Statistical Science for the Life and Behavioural sciences at Leiden Univerisity.

I want to challenge myself with this blog by writing about some interesting topics. It is all about the learning process and this blog can help me keep track on everything I will learn. 

See you soon!
